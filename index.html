            <p>Hello! My name is Nathaniel Richley. Welcome to my personal portfolio site!</p>
            <p>Here you will find information about my background, skills, and projects.</p>
            <p>One quote that I like:</p>
            <p>"Be strong and of good courage, do not be afraid or in dread of them, <br> for it is the Lord your God who goes with you; He will not fail you or forsake you."</p>
            <p> I enjoy training and competing in Kickboxing, also in my spare time I enjoy spending time with my grandmother and practicing my Hebrew skills.<p>
            <p>I would like to pursue Physical Therapy as a career and eventually study to become a Rabbi at the Rabbinical College Of America-Lubavitch</p>
